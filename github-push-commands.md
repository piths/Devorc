# GitHub Push Commands

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `devorch-suite`
3. Description: `AI-powered developer productivity platform built with Kiro AI - featuring GitHub integration, Kanban boards, project canvas, and intelligent code analysis`
4. Make it **Public** (for hackathon visibility)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push to GitHub
After creating the repository, run these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote (replace 'yourusername' with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/devorch-suite.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload
- Check that all files are visible on GitHub
- Verify the README displays properly
- Confirm the .kiro/specs/ folder is included

## Step 4: Add Repository Topics
On GitHub, go to your repository and add these topics:
- hackathon
- kiro-ai  
- nextjs
- typescript
- developer-tools
- productivity
- github-integration
- kanban
- ai-assistant
- shadcn-ui

## Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)
If you want to deploy the app:
1. Go to Settings > Pages
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: main / (root)
4. Or better yet, deploy to Vercel for a live demo

Your repository will be ready for hackathon submission! ðŸš€

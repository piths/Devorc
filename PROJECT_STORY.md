# Project Story

## Inspiration

The inspiration came from recognizing the fragmented nature of modern development workflows. Developers constantly switch between GitHub, project management tools, code editors, and AI assistants. We wanted to create a unified workspace that brings together repository management, visual project planning, intelligent chat assistance, and task management into one cohesive platform.

## What it does

Devorc Suite is an AI-powered developer productivity platform with four core modules:

- **GitHub Dashboard** - Comprehensive repository management with issue tracking, pull request workflows, and branch management
- **Smart Kanban** - Visual task management with GitHub synchronization for seamless project tracking
- **Project Canvas** - Interactive brainstorming and architecture visualization tool for planning and design
- **AI Chat Assistant** - Intelligent code analysis with repository codebase integration, file navigation, and development insights

The platform provides deep GitHub integration, real-time collaboration features, and a modern responsive UI with comprehensive dark/light theme support.

## How we built it

We built Devorc Suite using modern React patterns with **Next.js 15 App Router** and **TypeScript 5** for type safety. The architecture follows:

- **Component-based design** using shadcn/ui built on Radix UI primitives
- **Feature-based organization** with co-located tests and modular structure
- **Custom hooks** for reusable logic and API state management
- **React Context providers** for global state (GitHub auth, theme, storage)
- **Comprehensive testing** with Jest and React Testing Library
- **Advanced data handling** with @tanstack/react-table, @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop, and recharts for visualization

The chat system includes sophisticated features like repository codebase loading, file navigation, code analysis, and hybrid storage management using both LocalStorage and IndexedDB.

## Challenges we ran into

- **Complex state management** across multiple modules while maintaining performance
- **GitHub API integration** with proper authentication flows and rate limiting
- **File system navigation** and code analysis within the browser environment
- **Storage optimization** for large codebases using hybrid storage strategies
- **Real-time synchronization** between different views (Kanban, Canvas, Chat)
- **Responsive design** that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- **Comprehensive test coverage** with 50+ test files covering components, hooks, and services
- **Advanced chat interface** with repository integration, file navigation, and code insights
- **Sophisticated storage system** that handles large datasets efficiently
- **Clean architecture** with proper separation of concerns and TypeScript safety
- **Modern UI/UX** with accessibility considerations and theme support
- **AI-assisted development workflow** that demonstrates best practices for component composition and testing

## What we learned

- **Advanced React patterns** for complex state management and component composition
- **Next.js App Router** capabilities for building scalable applications
- **GitHub API integration** strategies and authentication flows
- **Browser storage optimization** techniques for handling large datasets
- **AI-assisted development** workflows and how they can accelerate productivity
- **Testing strategies** for complex React applications with external API dependencies

## What's next for Devorc Suite

- **Real-time collaboration** features with WebSocket integration
- **Advanced AI capabilities** including code generation and automated testing
- **Plugin system** for extending functionality with custom integrations
- **Team management** features with role-based access control
- **Performance analytics** and productivity insights dashboard
- **Mobile app** for on-the-go project management and code review
- **Integration marketplace** for connecting with additional development tools

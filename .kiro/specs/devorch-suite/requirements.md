# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Devorch Suite is an AI-powered developer productivity platform built with Next.js that integrates multiple productivity tools into a unified interface. The platform aims to streamline developer workflows by providing GitHub repository management, visual project planning, interactive brainstorming capabilities, and intelligent code analysis in a single, cohesive application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified dashboard interface, so that I can access all productivity tools from a single navigation system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a responsive sidebar navigation with all four core modules
2. WHEN a user clicks on a navigation item THEN the system SHALL switch to the corresponding module view
3. WHEN the application is viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a collapsible navigation menu
4. WHEN the user switches between modules THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth transitions and preserve the current state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage my GitHub repositories through a dashboard, so that I can track activity and manage projects efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects their GitHub account THEN the system SHALL authenticate using OAuth and store access tokens securely
2. WHEN the GitHub dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display a list of user repositories with key metrics
3. WHEN a user views repository details THEN the system SHALL show recent commits, issues, and pull requests
4. WHEN repository data is fetched THEN the system SHALL handle API rate limits and display appropriate loading states
5. IF GitHub API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display cached data with appropriate staleness indicators

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want a smart Kanban board with GitHub integration, so that I can visually manage tasks and sync with repository issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new board THEN the system SHALL allow custom column creation with drag-and-drop functionality
2. WHEN a user connects a board to a GitHub repository THEN the system SHALL sync issues as Kanban cards
3. WHEN a card is moved between columns THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding GitHub issue status
4. WHEN changes are made to GitHub issues externally THEN the system SHALL reflect updates in the Kanban board
5. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL store changes locally and sync when connectivity is restored

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an interactive project canvas, so that I can brainstorm ideas and create visual architecture diagrams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the canvas THEN the system SHALL provide a zoomable and pannable infinite workspace
2. WHEN a user adds elements to the canvas THEN the system SHALL support text boxes, shapes, and connecting lines
3. WHEN elements are created THEN the system SHALL allow real-time editing of properties like color, size, and text
4. WHEN multiple elements are selected THEN the system SHALL provide bulk editing capabilities
5. WHEN canvas data is modified THEN the system SHALL auto-save changes to local storage every 30 seconds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an AI-powered codebase chat assistant, so that I can get intelligent insights about my code and project structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads code files THEN the system SHALL analyze the codebase structure and provide contextual insights
2. WHEN a user asks questions about their code THEN the system SHALL provide relevant answers using AI analysis
3. WHEN code analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL identify potential improvements and best practices
4. WHEN the AI processes requests THEN the system SHALL display clear loading indicators and handle API failures gracefully
5. IF the OpenAI API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback responses and queue requests for retry

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a consistent dark theme interface, so that I can work comfortably in low-light environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL apply a dark theme with purple/blue accent colors (#6366f1, #8b5cf6)
2. WHEN UI components are rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling across all modules
3. WHEN interactive elements are hovered or focused THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback
4. WHEN the user switches between light and dark modes THEN the system SHALL persist the preference in local storage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable data persistence, so that my work is automatically saved and available across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is created or modified THEN the system SHALL automatically save to local storage
2. WHEN the application is reopened THEN the system SHALL restore the previous session state
3. WHEN local storage is full THEN the system SHALL implement a cleanup strategy for old data
4. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL provide recovery options and error reporting
5. IF local storage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality and notify the user

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want responsive design across all devices, so that I can use the platform on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt layouts appropriately
2. WHEN touch interactions are used THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets and gestures
3. WHEN the viewport changes orientation THEN the system SHALL reflow content without losing functionality
4. WHEN performance is measured on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth 60fps interactions
